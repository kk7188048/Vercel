Understanding __dirname
__dirname is a special variable in Node.js that provides the directory path of the current module file. For any given file, __dirname represents the directory where that file resides.

Example Scenario
Given your example, let's break down how __dirname is used:

File Path and __dirname Values:

File: /home/user/project/output/123/file.txt
__dirname: /home/user/project
Here, the __dirname is /home/user/project if the script that contains this line is located in /home/user/project.

What Happens in the Script:


const files = getAllFiles(path.join(__dirname, `output/${id}`));

files.forEach(async file => {
    await uploadFile(file.slice(__dirname.length + 1), file);
});
getAllFiles(path.join(__dirname, output/${id})): This function returns an array of file paths. The paths are relative to /home/user/project/output/${id}.

file.slice(__dirname.length + 1):

__dirname.length for /home/user/project is 17 characters.
file is /home/user/project/output/123/file.txt.
When you do file.slice(__dirname.length + 1), you are effectively slicing off the part of the file path up to /home/user/project/.
For example:


file = '/home/user/project/output/123/file.txt';
__dirname = '/home/user/project';
file.slice(__dirname.length + 1);  // 'output/123/file.txt'
This slicing operation removes the base directory /home/user/project from the file path, leaving you with the relative path output/123/file.txt.

Why __dirname Appears as /home/user/project
If you are seeing __dirname as /home/user/project even though the file path is /home/user/project/output/123/file.txt, it indicates:

The Current Module Directory: The module from which you are executing the script has its __dirname set to /home/user/project, not to /home/user/project/output/123. This means the script in question is located at /home/user/project, not in any subdirectories.

Correct Usage:

Ensure that the script or module where __dirname is used is indeed located at /home/user/project.
For scripts located deeper in subdirectories, __dirname would correctly reflect their directory, and the slicing operation would work accordingly.
Summary
__dirname reflects the directory of the currently executing script. In your case, if __dirname is /home/user/project, it means that the script itself is in /home/user/project, not in any subdirectories. The slicing operation effectively removes the base directory path, providing you with the relative path from the base directory.
